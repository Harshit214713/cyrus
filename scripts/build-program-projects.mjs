/* ══ scripts/build-program-projects.mjs — one machine-readable archive per program ══
   Run:  node scripts/build-program-projects.mjs [--offline]
         CYRUS_READ_AT=YYYY-MM-DD node scripts/build-program-projects.mjs

   It writes, and nothing else:

     public/data/program-projects/<id>.json   one archive per program
     public/data/program-projects.json        the index of all 13 programs

   Every shard uses the same contract (helpers in scripts/lib/shard.mjs):

     { program, label, source, readAt, unit, note, projects, orgs, list }
     list rows: y,u,t,o,s,tt,tp,b,m,url,program  (+ stars,lang,license only when a
     GitHub API response supplied them)

   `projects` is always exactly `list.length`, so a number in the index and a row
   on disk can never disagree. `unit` is the PROGRAM'S own word for one row -
     GSSoC's board counts projects a student opened, Season of KDE lists proposed
     ideas, 24 Pull Requests lists wishlist repositories, MLH leaves forks of
     upstream code - so nothing here is ever called an "accepted project" unless
     the program itself says so. src/lib/programRoster.ts ROSTER_UNIT is the
     guide; that file is the site and wins if the two ever disagree.

   ── where every row comes from, and the date it was read ───────────────────
   Nothing in this file is generated from a model's memory of a program. Each
   builder names the document or API response it parsed:

   gsoc        public/data/gsoc-projects.json (5,238 rows this site read from
               summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/<year>/archive; per-project
               size stays in that file, the shared row shape has no size column)
   lfx         public/data/otherProjects.json, program "LFX" (941 rows from
               api.mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org; LFX's own all-time total
               of 1,303 org-level projects is public/data/lfx-archive.json)
   outreachy   public/data/otherProjects.json, program "Outreachy" (437 rows
               read from outreachy.org project pages; the round name is taken
               from the slug Outreachy puts in each URL)
   sob         public/data/otherProjects.json, program "Summer of Bitcoin",
               then every github.com link re-read through the GitHub API
   gssoc       https://gssoc.girlscript.org/api/projects (live season board,
               cached to scripts/.cache/gssoc-board.json), each repo_url
               verified through the GitHub API
   kde         public/data/kde-archive.json `ideas` (MediaWiki source of
               community.kde.org/SoK/Ideas/<year>), wiki furniture lines dropped
   24pr        data/24pr-raw.json (24pullrequests.com/projects.json wishlist),
               each repo verified through the GitHub API
   mlh         data/mlh-parents.json - every repository under github.com/MLH-Fellowship
               and the upstream repository it was forked from, re-read per fork
   oct         public/data/issues.json.gz (our own 40,017-issue GitHub snapshot)
               filtered to repositories carrying a hacktoberfest label, plus
               GitHub search for `topic:hacktoberfest`
   fossee      https://fossee.in/fellowship/<year> result tables
               (scripts/fetch-fossee.mjs)
   vercel-oss  https://vercel.com/open-source-program cohort cards and past
               cohort lists (scripts/fetch-vercel-oss.mjs)
   nsoc        public/data/program-projects/nsoc.json is written by its own
               pipeline; this script READS it to index it and never writes it
   esoc        Eclipse SoC: probed, and there is no machine-readable archive
               (see probeEsoc). The index carries the reason instead of rows.

   Contribo's project rows are deliberately not used anywhere: they were checked
   and are synthetic (`gh api repos/nokia/5p-packet-sim` style links 404), so not
   one row in this archive came from them.

   No network access happens when the site imports anything - this is a build
   step; the browser only ever reads the JSON it produces.                  ═ */
