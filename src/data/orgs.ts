   It is then narrowed to the organizations a program actually names. The

   Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Vercel and the like - because their repositories
   are popular here. None of them appears in the GSoC, LFX, Outreachy or Summer
   of Bitcoin archives, and none of their tracked repos advertises one of those
   programs in its GitHub topics, so they were profile cards with no program
   behind them. cyrus.ai is a program directory, so they are not listed: 29 of
   the 393 fetched profiles drop out and the directory becomes the 364
   organizations some program's own record names. Their repositories stay in
   the catalog; orgByLogin() simply stops offering them an in-site profile page,
